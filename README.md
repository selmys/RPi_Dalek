# Raspberry Pi Driven Dr. Who Dalek Robot
I began thinking about this project in the summer of 2016.
I was inspired by my son and his swarm of children who,
at the time, were all [Dr. Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) fans.

I decided to model my Dalek after this image that I found somewhere on the web.

    * with 2 Bose wired mini speakers
    * connects to the Pi
* 2 Pittman DC servo gear motors (GM9236S019) 
* 1 Servo Control Box
    * connects to the 2 servo motors
    * uses serial interface to the Pi 
* 1 Big Easy (Sparkfun) stepper motor driver board
    * to control the stepper motor for the Dalek's head
