# Raspberry Pi Driven Dr. Who Dalek Robot
I began thinking about this project in the summer of 2016.
I was inspired by my son and his swarm of children who,
at the time, were all [Dr. Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) fans.

I decided to model my Dalek after this ![Dalek photo](/images/blueandgreydalek.jpg) that I found somewhere on the web.
