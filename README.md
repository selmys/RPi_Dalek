# Raspberry Pi Driven Dr. Who Dalek Robot
I began thinking about this project in the summer of 2016.
I was inspired by my son and his swarm of children who,
at the time, were all [Dr. Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) fans.

I decided to model my Dalek after this image that I found somewhere on the web.

I began by gathering up the parts.
* 1 Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
* 1 RS232 Serial Pi Plus Converter for Raspberry Pi
* 1 HiFiBerry Class-D power amplifier
* 2 Bose wired mini speakers
* 2 Pittman DC servo gear motors (GM9236S019) 
* 1 Big Easy (Sparkfun) stepper motor driver board
* 1 Stepper motor - 42BYGHM809
    * to rotate the head
* 1 Power supply with 12V 5ah Sealed Lead Acid Battery
